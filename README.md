# 2024-Embedded-Computing-System
The primary objective of this coursework is to develop a comprehensive understanding of embedded
systems, particularly in the areas of real-time DSP processing, FIR filtering, inter-processor
communication, and peripheral control. The seven tasks covered in this coursework span a variety of
embedded computing techniques, from microcontroller programming to real-time signal processing
and data transfer using DMA. The following report outlines the approach taken to complete each task,
the challenges encountered, and the solutions implemented.
